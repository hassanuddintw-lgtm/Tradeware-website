              When we started Tradeware, the goal was simple: make buying a vehicle from Japan feel as straightforward as buying one in your own city. No confusing fees, no hidden grades on the auction sheet, and no disappearing exporter once the car leaves port.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Today our team in Japan and overseas personally reviews every vehicle we offer, explains the true condition in plain language, and stays with you until the car is cleared at your port. Many of our customers are on their second or third purchase with us—that trust is our real measure of success.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Whether you are a dealer building stock or a first‑time buyer importing a family car, thank you for considering Tradeware. We look forward to earning your confidence, not just your first order.

    question: "How do I know the condition without seeing the car?",
    answer:
      "Each vehicle has an auction sheet (genjo) with a condition grade—e.g. 4.5B or 5—and a detailed report. We translate and explain these so you know exactly what you're buying. Optional inspections are available. Auctions are wholesale; condition is described, not guaranteed to retail standards.",

    id: "dont-win",
    question: "What happens if I don't win the auction?",
    answer:
      "You can bid on other vehicles in the same or later auctions. There's no obligation. We help you set realistic limits and suggest alternatives so you can find the right car without pressure.",
  },
  {
    id: "pricing-decided",
    question: "How is pricing decided at auction?",
    answer:
      "Auctions are wholesale markets: buyers bid and the highest bid wins. There's no fixed price. We advise on typical price ranges and help you set a maximum bid so you stay within your budget.",

  {
    id: "export-countries",
    question: "What countries do you export to?",
    answer:

  {
    id: "payment-secure",
    question: "Is payment secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We use secure, traceable payment methods. A deposit is required to place bids; we explain the process and timing clearly so you know what to expect at each step.",

  {
    id: "beginners",
    question: "Can beginners buy through auctions?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many first-time buyers use our service. We guide you through grades, auction sheets, and the full process so you can bid with the same confidence as an experienced dealer.",

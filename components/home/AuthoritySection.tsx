      "Japan's vehicle auctions (USS, TAA, CAA, and 120+ houses) run on a strict system. Each car gets an auction sheet (genjo) with a condition grade—e.g. 4.5B or 5—and a detailed report. Only licensed dealers and registered export agents can bid. We have direct access: our team in Yokohama attends and bids on your behalf. You see the same auction sheets we do, translated and explained, so you know exactly what you're buying before a single yen is committed.",

    icon: Shield,
    title: "Why Buying Through Us Is Safer Than Going Direct",
    content:
      "Direct bidding in Japan requires a local entity, language fluency, and familiarity with auction rules and export paperwork. One mistake on the auction sheet or export certificate can cost you. We act as your licensed buffer: we translate grades and damage codes, inspect vehicles when needed, and handle JEVIC (Japan Export Vehicle Inspection Center) certification and export documentation. You get a single point of contact, clear pricing in your currency, and no surprise fees—because we've done this for 15+ years and 10,000+ vehicles.",

    title: "Inspection, Grading, Shipping & Export in Practice",
    content:
      "After a winning bid, we coordinate mechanical and document checks, then prepare the vehicle for export. JEVIC inspection (where required) is arranged by us. We secure the export certificate, commercial invoice, and Bill of Lading, and ship from Japanese ports (Yokohama, Kobe, Osaka) through established carriers. You receive full paperwork and tracking. Grading (e.g. 5, 4.5, 4) reflects the auction house's assessment; we explain every grade and any repair history so you can buy with confidence.",

    icon: Building2,
    title: "Why Tradeware Is Trustworthy",
    content:
      "We are not a broker layer: we have a physical presence in Japan and direct contracts with auction houses. Every vehicle we offer has been sourced through official channels, with auction sheets and condition reports we stand behind. Our processes are ISO-aligned; payments are secure and traceable. We don't sell promises—we sell verified vehicles and complete export support. That's why dealers and private buyers in 50+ countries have used us for over a decade.",
